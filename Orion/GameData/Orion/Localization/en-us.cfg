    // MANUFACTURERS
    #LOC_SPO_manufacturer_title = Applied Atomiks
    #LOC_SPO_manufacturer_description = Originally founded after the explosive (figurative and literal) discovery of new ways of harnessing the infinite power of the atom. Since then, Applied Atomiks has ceaselessly sought to develop and market applications of this new technology. Proponents defend the company, stating they just haven't found their niche yet, while detractors grow ever more numerous following the disasterous rollout of their new Atomik Toaster (it toasts toast very, very quickly). Seeking to redeem their public image, Applied Atomiks has turned to the aerospace industry amidst rumors of a revolutionary new engine design.

	#LOC_SPO_5mOrion_name = AA-64 "Orion" Nuclear Pulse Propulsion Engine
	#LOC_SPO_5mOrion_desc = After the declassification of one or two explosive mishaps during the creation of the venerable LV-N, Applied Atomiks researchers were struck not by the size of the craters that were left, but by how far the debris flew, and wondered "What if we were to do that deliberately?" The Orion is the result, following decades of research into what makes LV-N cores explode, how to do it reliably, and how to minaturize the devices to allow enough of them to be carried to get anywhere worthwhile.
	#LOC_SPO_5mOrion_tags = ascent launch orion nuke propuls pulse boom

	#LOC_SPO_medusa_name = AA-x72 "Medusa" Nuclear Pulse Propulsion Engine
	#LOC_SPO_medusa_desc = The Medusa is a second-generation nuclear pulse propulsion engine, based on an unusual redesign of the core NPP design. Instead of the heavy and mechanically complex plate and suspension system, the Medusa utilizes a large fore-mounted sail to catch the explosion, and a winch system to provide a slower, smoother pulse cycle.

		//Tanks
	#LOC_SPO_smallMag_Name = Small Orion Magazine
	#LOC_SPO_medMag_Name = Medium Orion Magazine
	#LOC_SPO_largeMag_Name = Large Orion Magazine
	#LOC_SPO_Mag_desc = Following initial failed attempts to get an external fuel supply for the Orion drive, a partnership was reached with Sean's Cannery to take advantage of their knowledge of cans and can-adjacent technology. More a vending machine than a fuel tank, the Orion magazine holds an external supply of extra pulse units, and the machinery to transfer them to an attached Orion drive

	#LOC_SPO_largeLFO_Name = FS-191 Fuel Tank
	#LOC_SPO_medLFO_Name = FS-95 Fuel Tank
	#LOC_SPO_shortLFO_Name = FS-47 Fuel Tank
	#LOC_SPO_LFO_desc = With relatively little experience with aerospace design, Applied Atomiks engineeers adopted a 'Keep it Simple' approach that makes no pretense to weight-savings or fancy materials, only results. Welded together out of the finest plate steel, the FS line of Fuel Tanks are heavy and overengineered, but far more robust than competitor's offerings.
	#LOC_SPO_medRCS_Name = FS-R93 RCS Fuel Tank
	#LOC_SPO_shortRCS_Name = FS-R46 RCS Fuel Tank
	#LOC_SPO_RCS_desc = A cluster of sturdy Monopropellant tanks linked together and enclosed within a structural truss for ease of transport and construction, to provide sufficient RCS propellant for even the largest of vessels.
		//ISRU
	#LOC_SPO_UraniumProcessor_name = Uranium Enrichment Centerfuge
	#LOC_SPO_UraniumProcessor_desc = No stranger to the difficulties of procuring sufficient stockpiles of Uranium for their research and development teams, Applied Atomiks realised a long-term mission using an Orion Engine may have similar issues. Utilizing their know-how, the boffins were able to miniturize and ruggedize a Gas Centerfuge assembly to a size that would fit on an Orion vessel, allowing the creation of supplies of off-world Uranium (and concerned governmant agents). Unlike a conventional rocket that can produce ISRU fuel to keep it going, the process of manufacturing Pulse Units is more complex. The Enrichment Centerfuge is the first of a 2-step ISRU process to manufacture additional fuel for an Orion Engine. When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency.  These modules operate best at their ideal operating temperatures, and features auto-shutdown in the event of excessive overheating.  Radiators can be used to help manage excessive heat.

	#LOC_SPO_Smelter_name = 2H-07 Zero-Gravity Smelter
	#LOC_SPO_Smelter_desc = A compact blast furnace designed for operation in freefall, this unit allows the smelting of Metallic Ores into usable metals for offworld ISRU processess. When operated by a skilled engineer, you will be able to operate with better efficiency. These modules generate excessive temperatures, and radiators must be employed to manage the heat of their operation. Unlike a conventional rocket that can produce ISRU fuel to keep it going, the process of manufacturing Pulse Units is more complex. The Smelter is the first of a 2-step ISRU process to manufacture additional fuel for an Orion Engine.

	#LOC_SPO_Hab_Name = CH-8 "Space House" Crew Quarters
	#LOC_SPO_Hab_Desc = The CH-8 provides large scale living quarters for crew on long term voyages (or fussy tourists who don't want the cramped conditions of standard capsules), featuring a galley, mess, lounge, and individual staterooms to allow up to eight Kerbals to travel in style and comfort. Be the envy of other Space Programs today!

	#LOC_SPO_BigHab_Name = CH-12 "Star Hotel" Crew Quarters
	#LOC_SPO_BigHab_Desc = Large enough to feature all the comforts of home, your Kerbals will feel as if they never left (apart from the lack of gravity). With accomodations for up to 12 crew, the CH-12 will support the needs of almost any mission, regardless of destination or length.

	#LOC_SPO_SpineHab_S_Name = CH-2 "Kerbal Can" Crew Storage Container
	#LOC_SPO_SpineHab_S_desc = The CSC offers minimalist crew accomodations for the Space Program on a budget, where a place to put crew is more important than their long-term comfort.

	#LOC_SPO_Lab_Desc = No longer are you limited to research facilities only on Kerbin!  With the Mobile Processing Lab, you can conduct long-term experiments and ongoing research with the data you collect in the field.  Be sure to check back on your scientists from time to time, and transmit the results of their research home! This model is guaranteed to spontaneously combust less than previous models, and also has the equipment necessary to clean out and restore functionality to inoperable experiments.

	#LOC_SPO_RadCargoBay_Desc = Ever needed some extra carying capacity, but didn't know where to fit in an extra Cargo Bay? Now those worries are a thing of the past. The Radial Cargo Bay is a modular cargo solution for carrying small items into space that can be placed anyshere, and extended as needed, or left as a standard-sized bin.

	#LOC_SPO_SpineL_Name = Long Orion Spinal Truss
	#LOC_SPO_Spine_Desc = An overengineered skeletal truss frame designed to support payload or additional pulse unit magazines for an Orion Drive vessel. The crew compartment contains storage space for spare parts, as well as repairbays and workshops for maintainence and Pulse Unit manufacture. The Workshop is the second of a 2-step ISRU process to manufacture additional fuel for an Orion Engine.
